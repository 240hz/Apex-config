In the top my sensitivity and some other binds are bound. You might want to change that.   

videoconfig.txt location   
C:\Users\\[usr name]\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local   

autoexec.cfg location   
~~C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg~~   
C:\Users\\[usr name]\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local    
in settings.cfg type: exec autoexec.cfg   
Make the file read only.   
   
Due to some bug game wont start with commands in launch options any more.
